🩺 Diabetes Prediction using SVM

📌 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical data. It uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification and is implemented using Python with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.

🚀 Features

Data Preprocessing using StandardScaler

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Training an SVM classifier with a linear kernel

Evaluating model performance using accuracy score

Accepting custom input data for real-time predictions

📂 Dataset

The model is trained using the Diabetes dataset, which consists of medical attributes such as:

Number of pregnancies

Glucose level

Blood pressure

Skin thickness

Insulin level

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

Outcome (Diabetic or Not)

🛠 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/nishantCodes123/diabetes-prediction.git

Install required dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Run the script in Google Colab or a local Python environment.

📜 Usage

Upload the diabetes.csv file.

Run the script to preprocess data and train the SVM model.

The model will predict diabetes based on user input.

Example Input:

input_data = (4,110,92,0,0,37.6,0.191,30)

Example Output:

Unfortunately, the person is diabetic.
